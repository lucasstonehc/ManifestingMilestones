        <p class="italic">Navigating English with confidence, culture, and clarity.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>I'm a Canadian who's been living in Brazil for some years now.</strong> As someone navigating life in a second language, I understand how frustrating it can be when you canâ€™t express yourself the way you want to â€” especially when you're already at an intermediate level and craving more than just textbook English. Letâ€™s face it, textbook English is helpful when you are a beginner, but you donâ€™t want to sound robotic forever, do you?</p>

      <p><strong>Iâ€™m an online Conversational English and Self-Expression Coach.</strong> I specialize in helping people who want to sound more natural and confident in real-life English. Something Iâ€™ve learned from living in Brazil is that language and culture are inseparable. Itâ€™s not just about sounding like a native â€” itâ€™s about understanding natives when they speak.</p>

      <p><strong>Communication goes both ways.</strong> When youâ€™re moving between cultures, you need more than grammar rules â€” you need cultural insight. Thatâ€™s where I come in. Being familiar with both Brazilian and Canadian cultures, I help bridge that gap. I understand the common challenges, misunderstandings, and unique expressions that can trip people up, and I help you navigate them with clarity and confidence.</p>

      <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-[#604176] p-4 shadow-sm">
        <p class="italic">This isnâ€™t a traditional ESL class. There are no grammar drills or textbooks here.</p>
        <p>I offer a relaxed, supportive space where you can speak freely, make mistakes without judgment, and grow into the confident English speaker you want to be. Grammar correction happens gently and only when needed for clarity. The focus is on communication, not perfection.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Youâ€™ll learn how native speakers really talk:</strong> idioms, slang, expressions, humour, and the flow of natural conversation. Itâ€™s not just about learning English â€” it's about using it to express <em>you</em>.</p>

      <p>Weâ€™ll talk about your life, goals, culture, challenges, and anything else youâ€™d talk about with a trusted friend (with a bit more structure and professional guidance, of course!). Have a question youâ€™re normally embarrassed to ask? Donâ€™t be! You can run it by me first, in a safe space where you can experiment, learn, and feel prepared for the real world.</p>

      <p><strong>Whether you're looking to:</strong> feel more natural in conversation, gain confidence in meetings, express yourself more clearly in social situations, or simply enjoy a deeper connection to the English-speaking world â€” Iâ€™m here to help.</p>

      <p>I bring patience, positivity, and personal experience of what it feels like to be in your shoes.</p>
